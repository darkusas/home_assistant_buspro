# HDL Buspro

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-41BDF5.svg)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

The HDL Buspro integration allows you to control your HDL Buspro system from Home Assistant.

## Installation
Under HACS -> Integrations, add custom repository "https://github.com/eyesoft/home_assistant_buspro/" with Category "Integration". Select the integration named "HDL Buspro" and download it.

Restart Home Assistant.

Go to Settings > Integrations and Add Integration "HDL Buspro". Type in IP address and port number of the gateway.

Older Devices like CMS-PIR are supported via PIR

#### Climate platform

To use your Buspro panel climate control in your installation, add the following to your configuration.yaml file: 

Added Support for AC Control via DLP Panel command, we need to mention Subnet and Device ID of Room DLP Panel which can be used to control  the AC.
I have removed Floor Heating and Heating Modes for my needs, but someone requiring Floor heating instead of Air Conditioner use climate.py from Original Repo or merge both to and create an option for panel type as floor heater and ac and also mention option to provide their supported modes like cooling and heating.


```yaml
climate:
  - platform: buspro
    devices:
      - address: '1.74'
        name: Living Room
      - address: '1.74'
        name: Front Door
```
+ **devices** _(Required)_: A list of devices to set up
  + **address** _(string) (Required)_: The address of the sensor device on the format `<subnet ID>.<device ID>`
  + **name** _(string) (Required)_: The name of the device

#### List of Changes in this Fork:

## General Changes:
I have updated polling / status update on HA startup for all devices, so all devices start showing available.
I have also fixed update process on various devices to report correct device status

## Device wise Change List : 
# Binary sensor:

Added additional option 
device: 

with options 
8in1
12in1
pir
Older devices like PIR do not respond to request sensor status, but newer devices do, so we can set our device type
Added additional BusPro code to check status of CMS-PIR Motion Sensors

# sensor:
Fixed temperature variance of 20 degree on certain devices and more frequent reporting of current temperature status.

# climate :

Added Support for AC Control via DLP Panel command, we need to mention Subnet and Device ID of Room DLP Panel which can be used to control  the AC.
I have removed Floor Heating and Heating Modes for my needs, but someone can merge both climate.py and create an option for panel type as floor heater and ac and also mention option to provide their supported modes like cooling and heating.

# cover :

I have added Extensive Curtain support forked from IlPicasso (https://github.com/IlPicasso/home_assistant_buspro) 
additional option :
opening_time : in seconds (default 20)
adjustable : True or False (default True)

Made Curtain supported on Google Assistant.
Made Curtain Adjustable to specific position and also report current position.
You need to check on stopwatch how many seconds it takes to open a particular curtain and mention that time in opening_time (set as 20s by default)
Based on it, it will calculate current position while opening and closing
When Curtain Position is set in between open and close then it will first close the curtain , so we can be sure that status of curtain is synced with the HA as there is no way in BusPro to know current status of curtain, then it will open the curtain to desired position.
All is based on time, so to open Curtain at 50% it will take 30 seconds if opening time is 20s, 
20 seconds to completely close it, whatever condition it is in and 10s to open it to 50

It keeps curtain position reported at 99% or 1% so both open and close button remain active, so in case position is not matching with buspro you can still operate the button and it doesnt get greyed out.

# Added additional device FAN

configuration is same as light with optional dimmable which can be set to false if Fan speed cannot be set.

This shows Fan seperately on Google Home and HA, so they are not confused with lights

# Light:
non dimmable lights were reporting as dimmable to HA, fixed this bug
Fixed current status getting updated on HA
